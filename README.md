Massinissa is a Malware Prediction Data!¶  If you don’t have data of your own, consider the Kaggle dataset on Microsoft Malware prediction available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data . Of course if you can predict the HasDetections ground truth variable we’ll be impressed. However, we are interested in other insights you can extract from the data and how you build your intuitions about the data. If possible, please provide the code for your analysis.
